# Utilities

This folder contains the cross-platform WSIWindow utility, for easily creating a Vulkan window.  
Please see the docs in the WSIWindow folder, for more details.

The two included demos show how to use WSIWindow:

 - WSIWindow_Test creates a Vulkan window, and shows how to handle keyboard, mouse, touch and window events.
 - Teapots is a clone of the Hologram demo, ported to use the WSIWindow utility.
